1. Esptouch Demo version is v0.2.1

    ( The indepedent Esptouch Demo, please refer to
     
     https://github.com/EspressifApp/EsptouchForAndroid )

2. How to use python and log4j to turn on/off log

    2.1 cd PROJECT_DIR/python 
    
        PROJECT_DIR means the directory of the project where contains '.project'

    2.2 python xml_file_search.py

        ( generate log4j.xml )

    2.3 vi log4j.xml and modify it as you like

        ( Our log4j support "OFF FATAL ERROR WARN INFO DEBUG TRACE ALL"
     
        Besides, we support "IGNORE" which means its level is depended upon

        its parent's level. ) 

    2.4 python xml_parse.py 
    
        ( it will change InitLogger.java according to log4j.xml automatically )
3. DB

    We use greendao as our ORM database
    
    ( More info about greendao, please refer to 
      
      https://github.com/greenrobot/greenDAO and http://greendao-orm.com/ )

4. The framework of the source code

        The layer of our source code are seperated as:

        UI, INTERFACE, TYPE, MODEL, ACTION, COMMAND, BASE, OPEN, DB, DB-gen, UTIL, LOG, ESPTOUCH

    4.1 UI:

        UI layer is just the UI, it shouldn't contain complex business logical.

    4.2 INTERFACE:

        INTERFACE layer contains the interfaces, it defines the interface to be implemented.

    4.3 TYPE:

        TYPE layer contains the property type, including device's type, device's state,

        device's status, device's timer and etc.

    4.4 MODEL:

        MODEL layer contains various models. The differece between TYPE and MODEL is that

        TYPE just stores the property but model contains business logical.

    4.5 ACTION:

        ACTION layer contains various actions. The action is based upon command.

        ACTION = COMMANDS + BUSINESS LOGICAL

    4.6 COMMAND:

        COMMAND layer contains various commands. The command is the basis of action.

        COMMAND is pure command without any logical.

    4.7 BASE:

        BASE layer is the basic layer, which is the base of the iot espressif apk.

    4.8 OPEN:

        OPEN layer is used to store open api and source code, such as zxing, from others.

    4.9 DB:

        DB layer is used to make the intermediate layer between DB-gen and upper layer.

    4.10 DB-gen:

        DB-gen layer is generated by greendao to implement ORM.

    4.11 UTIL:

        UTIL layer contains various utilities classes.

    4.12 LOG:

        LOG layer is the layer about logging. Log4j is used at present.

    4.13 ESPTOUCH:

        ESPTOUCH layer contains the source code of esptouch. ESPTOUCH layer is an indepent layer.

        At present, only UI layer depends upon it. And it is just used to display a ESPTOUCH demo.
